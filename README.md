# Coursera_Capstone
This is the repository for the final project of the IBM Data Science Certification. In this project, I explore the restaurant scene in Philadelphia PA, and experiement with geospatial analyses and machine learning classifiers. The aim of the project was to predict the rating of a restaurant given some redialy available data through the [Foursquare API](https://foursquare.com/) without creating a premium account. 

Files in repo: 
* Capstone_Final.ipynb: Main python notebook
* Capstone_Report.pdf: A thorough report of the project
* CourseraCapstone_presentation.pdf: Presentation of project
* All CSV files: datasets used in the notebook, created using the foursquare
